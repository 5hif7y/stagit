stagit
======

static git page generator


Usage

	$ mkdir -p htmldir && cd htmldir
	$ stagit path-to-repo

Make index file for repositories:

	$ stagit-index repodir1 repodir2 repodir3 > index.html

-------

$ make
# doas make install


Dependencies
------------

- libgit2 (v0.22+).
- C compiler
- make


Documentation
-------------

$ man stagit
$ man stagit-index


Features
--------

- Log of all commits.
- Log and diffstat per commit.
- Show file tree with linkable line numbers.
- Detect README and LICENSE file from HEAD and link it as a webpage.
- Atom feed log.
- Make index page for multiple repositories with stagit-index.
- After generating the pages (relatively slow) serving the files is very fast,
  simple and requires little resources (because the content is static), only
  a HTTP file server is required.


Cons
----

- Not suitable for large repositories (2000+ commits).
- Not suitable for repositories with many branches, a quite linear history is assumed.
- Relatively slow to run the first time (about 3 seconds for sbase, 1500+ commits),
  incremental updates after it are faster.
