stagit
======

static git page generator


Usage
-----

Make files per repository:

	$ mkdir -p htmldir && cd htmldir
	$ stagit path-to-repo

Make index file for repositories:

	$ stagit-index repodir1 repodir2 repodir3 > index.html


Install
-------

$ make
# doas make install


Dependencies
------------

- libgit2 (v0.22+).
- libc (tested with OpenBSD, FreeBSD, glibc and musl).
- C compiler (C99).
- make


Documentation
-------------

See man pages: stagit(1) and stagit-index(1).


Features
--------

- Log of all commits from HEAD.
- Log and diffstat per commit.
- Show file tree with linkable line numbers.
- Show references: local branches and tags.
- Detect README and LICENSE file from HEAD and link it as a webpage.
- Atom feed log (atom.xml).
- Make index page for multiple repositories with stagit-index.
- After generating the pages (relatively slow) serving the files is very fast,
  simple and requires little resources (because the content is static), only
  a HTTP file server is required.


Cons
----

- Not suitable for large repositories (2000+ commits), because diffstats are
  an expensive operation.
- Not suitable for repositories with many branches, a quite linear history is
  assumed (from HEAD).
- Relatively slow to run the first time (about 3 seconds for sbase,
  1500+ commits), incremental updates after it are faster.
- Does not support some of the dynamic features cgit has, like:
  - snapshot tarballs.
  - file tree per commit.
  - history log of branches diverged from HEAD.
  - stats (git shortlog -s).

  this is by design, just use git locally.
