marketing:
- rename project: stagit?

performance:
- optimize git_diff_get_stats.
- speed up generating files.
- be smarter about changes (an existing commit can never change the diff page).

layout:
- make top menu look nicer in links/lynx again.

documentation:
- improve mandoc pages.
  - document .git/description, .git/owner and .git/url

idea:
- program to write index for multiple repos: urmoms-index <repodir>...
